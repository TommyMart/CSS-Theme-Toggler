The dice rolling app is a dynamic and interactive tool designed to simulate the rolling of dice, offering users a visually appealing and engaging experience. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the app allows users to input a desired dice size (ranging from 1 to 20 sides) and roll the dice to generate a random outcome. The app features responsive design elements, including a centered display for dice results and a stylized interface with a toggleable theme. Enhanced with animations and thoughtful CSS styling, the app is both functional and visually captivating, making it a fun way to explore programming concepts and UI design.
